# Understanding Neural Networks

I was goin over this ![this notebook](https://github.com/lovellbrian/course22/blob/master/04-how-does-a-neural-net-really-work.ipynb) trying to get an understanding of gradient descent and neural networks.

From what I understand know, neural networks are composed of layers which:
1. Accept and process inputs by multiplying them by weights
2. Add the inputs together
3. Set any negative results to zero
This general process is repeated for each layer, with the inputs of previous layers acting as inputs to new ones.
However, to do useful work, we need some way to change the values of the
